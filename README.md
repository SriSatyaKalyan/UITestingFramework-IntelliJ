# UITestingFramework
A testing framework which runs few tests which put to test different UI aspects of the following page: 
http://www.qaclickacademy.com/

Observations:
1) The tests will be run using Jenkins tool and the reports will be generated
2) Extent Test reports will be used for better representation

To be noted:
1) The tests are purely made for learning purposes and so, validating them and questioning the author is a strict no-no
2) An upcoming testing framework which tests the APIs is in the works and will be released shortly
3) Though questioning the author is prohibited, pointing the errors and coming up with a better solution is encouraged
